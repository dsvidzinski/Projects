///***BACKGROUND***///

I implemented a FIX 5.0 parser. FIX 5.0 is noticibly different from previous versions. 

For example according to : http://fixparser.targetcompid.com/

8=FIX.4.1^A9=103^A35=D^A34=4^A49=BANZAI^A52=20121105-23:24:55^A56=EXEC^A11=1352157895032^A21=1^A38=10000^A40=1^A54=1^A55=ORCL^A59=0^A10=047^A 

is a valid message for NEW ORDER SINGLE;  

HOWEVER IN FIX 5.0 according to http://www.onixs.biz/fix-dictionary/5.0/msgType_D_68.html  NEW ORDER SINGLEs do NOT contain tags 38 and 55 - be vigilant with your input!


///***HOW THINGS WORK***///

First, please take a look at “input” and “FIX.html” files
input - is a file where the user should provide his messages. 
FIX.html - is how parsed messages should look like in HTML (I used Chrome ) 

You can delete FIX.html file if you like, a new one will be automatically regenerated

NOTE: The only file that should be modified by a user is "input" - DO NOT MODIFY ANY OTHER FILES 


1) cd into FIX_5.0 directory

2) Provide input messages in a file called input. There is an existing input file in the directory. Please take a look at how messages should be formated if you havent done 
   so already.  Delimeters are represented by "^A" symbol
   
3) type "make" in a terminal - this should compile all the necessary files and produce ./result executable  

4) execute ./result - this produces FIX.html file.

5) to clean up type "make clean"


Pay attention to the terminal output. If input messages contain errors or are not compatible with FIX 5.0 standard, there will be reported errors. 

NOTE: MY message library does not contain lower case message types; so 35=a will not work. I do have the rest of the messages which is about 75/100 for FIX 5.0
