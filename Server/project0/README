I provide separate folders with separate 
Makefiles for client and server. 

Server: 
To compile and run, type make or make server 
Server will be listening on port 8888

Client: 
To compile and run, type make or make client
Client will be logining into IP 128.135.165.171 (linux1) 
and sending messages to port 8888 

NOTE: If you are on linux2 machine, the IP address is 128.135.165.173
